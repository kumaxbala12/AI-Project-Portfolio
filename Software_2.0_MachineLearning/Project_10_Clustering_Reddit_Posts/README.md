# Project 10 – Clustering Reddit Posts

## 📄 Project Description
This project clusters Reddit posts into meaningful groups using unsupervised machine learning. It uses NLP techniques and clustering algorithms to find hidden themes in user-generated content.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Scrape Reddit posts using the PRAW or Pushshift API
- Clean and vectorize text data
- Apply clustering algorithms to discover discussion topics
- Visualize clustered themes with word clouds or dimensionality reduction

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
Python, PRAW, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, WordCloud, T-SNE, KMeans

## 📊 Dataset
- Source: Reddit posts scraped from subreddits like `r/technology`, `r/AskReddit`, or `r/science`

## 🔍 Key Steps
1. Data Collection with Reddit API
2. Text Cleaning and TF-IDF Vectorization
3. KMeans Clustering and Topic Labeling
4. Dimensionality Reduction with T-SNE for Visualization
5. Interpret Clusters with Top Terms and Word Clouds

## ✅ Results
- Number of Clusters: 5 (optimal via Elbow Method)
- Common Topics: Tech trends, healthcare, daily life struggles, education, politics

## 📌 Takeaways
- Demonstrated ability to extract insights from unstructured text
- Effective use of unsupervised learning for topic modeling
- Valuable for market research and social media analytics
